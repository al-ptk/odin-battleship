# odin-battleship

(Project on-going)

## Things I learned:

- How to config the project and its tools. It was tricky until I realised I must install things in the right order and with separate npm commands, besides following Jest's getting started page.
- Complexity are very scary. Test-driven delevopment is very cool. Encapsulation makes debugging and expanding annoying. 
- Few things in the world compares to the pleasure of fixing an agoninzing bug and seeing the whole thing just working. God, I love programming.
- I need a system for refactoring code. It can get messy and wild.
