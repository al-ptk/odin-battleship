## Things I learned:

- How to config the project and its tools. It was tricky until I realised I must install things in the right order and with separate npm commands, besides following Jest's getting started page.
- Complexity are very scary. Test-driven delevopment is very cool. Encapsulation makes debugging and expanding code a bit inconvinient.
- Few things in the world compares to the pleasure of fixing an agoninzing bug and seeing the whole thing just working. God, I love programming.
- Code gets real messy, real fast. I need a system for refactoring code.

## For the Future:

- Improve UX of the game:
  - Add cues for knowing which board is the player's and which is the enemy's;
  - Add cues for when you can't place a ship (invalid or taken spot);
- Improve UI of the game:
  - Add frame to boards;
  - Get better ship and flame sprites;
  - Improve orientation toggle button;
  - Make setup-board show ships instead of white blocks;
- Stop player from shooting same place twice.
- Optimize desktop interface.
- Add ship explosion feature, where the surroundings of a sunk ship are revealed;
